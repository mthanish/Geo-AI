# GeoAI Mapper 🌍
**AI-Based Mineral Prospectivity Mapping in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh**

This project uses geospatial machine learning to predict mineral-rich zones — such as those favorable for copper or gold — using geological features like lithology, fault proximity, and structural folds. The results are visualized as a color-coded map using an interactive Streamlit web app.

## 🔍 Features

- Extracts features from multi-layer geological data
- Trains a machine learning model (Random Forest) to simulate mineral potential
- Outputs prediction heatmaps with latitude & longitude for easy GIS mapping
- Interactive Streamlit app with filtering and map visualization
